Project title: Student Club Management System
i.	Project requirement:
The student club management system will require user management for registered users, event management for events related to available clubs, and club management for creating, updating and deleting clubs. The purpose of (student) club management system is to facilitate new students or interested members to know what available clubs in the school and choose which ever the feel comfortable to join to. The expect outcome is that student in charge of clubs will be able to manage clubs and related events. The constraint/limitation is that it lacks the admin user implementation.

ii.	Project plan:
The student club management system is to be used in any education institution that have clubs and wants a good management for them. The scope of the system is club and related event management. Resources used for the system are spring boot for backend, and for frontend: html, CSS, JavaScript and Thymeleaf. And MySQL for database management.
